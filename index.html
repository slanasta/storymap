<h2> THE RUNDOWN </h2>
<br>
        <p>
          <b> A Star is Born </b>
        </p>

        <p>I was born in Danbury, CT, at Danbury Hospital on July 30, 2002. I am the firstborn in my family, making me the oldest of three girls. I grew up a town over from Danbury in Bethel, CT. My dad grew up in Bethel and stayed so he could take over the family business after he graduated college. My mom is a native New Yorker who grew up in Brooklyn but moved to Bethel to be with my dad. Two years after I was born, my little sister was born. Four years after Miranda was born, my youngest sister Talia was born. Being the oldest daughter and sister in my family has become a huge part of my identity. </p>
        <br>

        <p>
          <b> My Educational Experience </b>
        </p>

        <p> I graduated from Bethel High School in June of 2020. I attended public school in my town of Bethel from K-12. During my junior year of high school, I applied to the School of the New York Times Summer Academy program in New York City. At the time, I felt lost and unsure of what I wanted to pursue in college. After stumbling upon the program on Facebook, I immediately sent in my application. I was able to take a writing course under the guidance of NYT published journalist Judith Matloff and explored New York with amazing people from across the country. This experience was invaluable as I discovered my passion for journalism and love for New York. Today, I study digital journalism at the S.I. Newhouse School of Communications at Syracuse University. While my college experience has been anything but ordinary, I'm so grateful to be here. Next semester, my younger sister will also be attending SU to study architecture, and I am so excited to have her here with me.  </p>
